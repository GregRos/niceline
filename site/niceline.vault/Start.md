`niceline` is a small Unicode-based **typesetting** library. It lets you carefully 

- It can **render** all kinds of visual elements commonly used in command-line interfaces, such as progress bars.
- It has an ASCII syntax for specifying Unicode characters.
    - Various occult symbols used in alchemy, mathematics, and engineering.
    - Spacing and control characters, such as allowing or preventing line breaks, changing text direction, and so on.
- It can render **formatted text** in places that don’t support traditional formatting..

`niceline` doesn’t actually do much beyond letting you explore the treasure trove of Unicode characters in various ways, so its features strongly depend on the frontend being able to render those characters in the first place.

Luckily, almost all modern frontends, including terminal emulators, text editors, and window systems have been able to render these characters for quite a while.
