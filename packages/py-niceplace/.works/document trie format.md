# ONLY MODIFY
- unicode-dict/.../format.md

# CONSIDER
- [about linking between YAML files](../../ts-replacer/.works/link-yaml.md)
- [about YAML file structure](../../ts-replacer/.works/write-yaml.md)
- [folder containing dictionary structure](../../unicode-dict/terms)

# ONLY DO
You must document the recursive, namespaced unicode dictionary format in the `format.md` file. 

- Documentation must be language agnostic.
- The files are intended to be read from both TypeScript and Python.
- Make sure to describe how `<-` linking works.
